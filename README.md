# Autism Spectrum Distorder Dataset for Toddlers

This repository uses data from [Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vaishnavisirigiri/autism-dataset-for-toddlers) dataset to train machine learning models that can predict whether a toddler is autistic.

The development of this program is part of the curriculum for the [Artificial Intelligence](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=520334) course.
